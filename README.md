Coding Style

All variables have capital letters for the first letter of each word

e.g.
CapitalLetter = []
FirstWord = "abc"


Variables that represent a constant number use all capital letters
and underscores

e.g.
HYPOTENUSE = 5
NUM_ROWS = 6


Classes have a lower case c as a prefix

e.g.
cArmVisualiser
cArmKinematics



Methods have a lower case m as a prefix

e.g.
mNumFinder()
mConstructor()
